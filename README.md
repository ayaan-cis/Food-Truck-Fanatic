# Food-Truck-Fanatic
This project appears to be a web application for a food truck, named "Food Truck Fanatic." Here's a brief description of the project:

Food Truck Fanatic Web Application

Purpose: The purpose of this web application is to allow users to interact with a food truck menu, place orders, and save their information for future orders.

Key Features:
Phone Number Entry: Users are prompted to enter their 10-digit phone number when they visit the website.
User Information: The application allows users to enter their name and address, which is associated with their phone number.
Menu Ordering: Users can browse a menu of food items and drinks, select items, specify quantities, and add them to their order.
Order Summary: The application displays a summary of the user's current order, including selected items, quantities, and total prices.
Order Completion: Users can complete their order and receive a total price for their selections.
Order History: The application is designed to save user information and order history for future visits.
Technologies Used: The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end, and PHP for server-side scripting. It also interacts with a MySQL database to store user information and order history.

Functionality: The application prompts users to enter their phone numbers. If it's their first time, they can provide their name and address. Users can then browse the menu, add items to their order, and complete the order. The application is designed to remember users' information and order history for convenience.

Overall, this project combines front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with back-end scripting (PHP and MySQL) to create a user-friendly food truck ordering system.
